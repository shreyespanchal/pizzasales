# PizzaSales

This project involves analyzing the sales data of a pizza store over the course of a year. Key insights include identifying the busiest days of the week and months of the year, as well as examining the contribution of different pizza categories to overall sales and orders.

## Project Overview

### Analysis & Insights
- **Sales Overview**: The analysis focuses on various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as:
  - **Total Revenue**
  - **Average Order Value**
  - **Total Pizzas Sold**
  - **Total Orders**
  - **Average Pizzas Ordered per Order**
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Daily Trend for Orders**: Shows how the number of orders fluctuates on a daily basis.
  - **Monthly Trend for Orders**: A monthly breakdown of pizza orders.
  - **% of Sales by Pizza Category**: Displays the sales contribution of different pizza categories.
  - **% of Sales by Pizza Size**: Shows how sales are distributed among different pizza sizes.
  - **Total Pizza Sold by Pizza Category**: Breakdown of total pizzas sold by category.

### Best & Worst Sellers
- **Page 2 of the report** provides an in-depth analysis of the **Top 5** and **Bottom 5** pizzas, based on:
  - Revenue
  - Quantity Sold
  - Number of Orders
- Visualizations for these metrics are presented for easy comparison.
- Additionally, the **Best and Worst Categories** are highlighted for a clearer understanding of the contribution of each pizza category to the overall sales and order volume.

### Interactive Features
- **Slicers**: Both pages of the report (Home and Best/Worst Sellers) include slicers that allow users to filter the data by:
  - Pizza Category
  - Period of Analyzed Sales Data (e.g., by month or year)

This feature enables a more dynamic and detailed exploration of the sales data.
